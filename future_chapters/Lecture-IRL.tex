\section{Inverse Reinforcement Learning}

The classical reinforcement problem has as inputs the dynamics and
the rewards and the output is the optimal policy. In the inverse
reinforcement learning problem we are given access to the optimal
policy and the dynamics, and would like to learn a reward function
which induces the given optimal policy.

More specifically, we are given as inputs the states $S$, actions
$A$, dynamics $p(\cdot|s,a)$, and access to the optimal policy
$\pi^*$, either explicitly or implicitly, by observing trajectories
of $\pi^*$.

We have a few related problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Behavioral cloning: given trajectories learn the optimal policy.
\item
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL): which recovers a reward
function $R$ for which $\pi^*$ is optimal.
\item
Apprentice learning: Learn a near-optimal policy given access to
trajectories of an optimal policy.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Behavioral Cloning}

Formulated as a classical supervised classification problem. Given
trajectories generated from $\pi^*$, we extract pairs $(s_t,a_t)$,
where $\pi^*(s_t)=a_t$. We do not need to know the dynamics or the
rewards. We define a classification problem, where the training
examples are ${\cal S}=\{(s_t,a_t)\}$.

We can now learn a classifier for ${\cal S}$, and use any
classifier, DNN, SVM, decision tree, and more. We learn the optimal
policy as a classification problem, and if we have low error we can
hope for performance near that of the optimal policy.

There are a few problems with the approach. After we make errors we
might reach completely new states, which we never encountered before
(since the optimal policy never reaches them). Also, the different
errors might have very different effects, but we treat them all
equally. Other issues include generalization, which would depend on
the test and train distributions (of states) being identical, but
small differences in the policies might lead to significant
differences in the distributions.


\subsection{IRL: small state space}

Assume we can use a look-up table to represent the policies. We are
given the set of states $S$, actions $A$, $p(\cdot|s,a)$ and the
optimal policy $\pi^*$. (All are given explicitly, as look-up
tables.) The output of the algorithm is a reward function $r(s,a)$
for which $\pi^*$ is optimal.

We first characterize all the rewards $R$ for which $\pi^*$ is
optimal. Bellman optimality requires that for every $s\in S$ and
$a\in A$ we have,
\[
Q^*(s,\pi^*(s))\geq Q^*(s,a)
\]
First we will try to get a more explicit characterization.

For simplicity of the notation let $a_1=\pi^*(s)$ for every $s\in
S$. (This is simply renaming the actions.) Also, we associate the rewards with states (rater
then state-action pairs). Define matrices $P^a$,
for $a\in A$, as follows: $P^a[i,j]=p(s_j|s_i,a)$, which is the
transition probabilities using action $a$. Since $a_1$ is the
optimal action, we define $P^*=P^{a_1}$.

For the optimal value function $V^*\in \mathbb{R}^{|S|}$ has
\[
V^*=R+\gamma P^*V^*
\]
This implies that $V^*=(I-\gamma P^*)^{-1}R$. (The inverse exists,
since the eigenvalues of $P^*$ are in the unit circle, hence, all
the eigenvalues of $I-\gamma P^*$ are non-zero.)

The optimal state-action function is,
\[
Q^*=R+\gamma P^a V^*=R+\gamma P^a (I-\gamma P^*)^{-1}R
\]
From the Bellman optimality we have $Q^*(s,\pi^*(s))- Q^*(s,a)\geq
0$ which implies,
\[
(P^*-P^a) (I-\gamma P^*)^{-1}R\geq 0
\]

This establishes the following claim:
\begin{claim}
Reward function $R$ is optimal iff $(P^*-P^a) (I-\gamma
P^*)^{-1}R\geq 0$.
\end{claim}

Although we have an exact characterization, we have a few
challenges.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Trivial solutions: We can simply set $R=0$ and any policy is
optimal!
\item
What happens if we observe only trajectories of $\pi^*$ and not the
explicit policy and dynamics.
\item
Large state space.
\end{enumerate}

To overcome the ambiguity of the reward function we can set an
objective that will force a unique outcome. One solution is a {\em
max margin}, specifically,
\[
\max_{s\in S} \left\{ Q^*(s,a^*)-\max_{a\neq a^*} Q^*(s,a) \right\}
\]
The resulting linear program is,\\
\begin{align*}
&\max \lambda\\
\forall a^*\neq a\;\;\;\; & (P^*-P^a) (I-\gamma P^*)^{-1}R\geq \lambda  \\
&-R_{max}\leq R\leq R_{max}
\end{align*}


\subsection{AL: Linear function approximation}

In this section we consider the case where we are given access to
trajectories of the optimal policy, in a large state space. Our goal
is to find a near optimal policy.
%Since we have a large state space we would use function approximation.
%
We consider a  simple case that the rewards are linear in the state
representation. For each state $s\in S$ we have
$\phi(s)\in\mathbb{R}^n$. There is a reward weights
$w\in\mathbb{R}^n$. The reward in state $s$ is $w^\top \phi(s)$.

Consider the value function of the policy $\pi$.
\begin{align*}
V^*(s_0) =& E[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t|\pi]\\
 =& E[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t w^\top \phi(s_t)|\pi]\\
 =& w^\top  \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^tE[ \phi(s_t)|\pi]\\
 =& w^\top \mu(\pi)
\end{align*}
where $\mu(\pi)=\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^tE[ \phi(s_t)|\pi]$. Note
that $\mu(\pi)$ depends on the dynamics (steady state distribution)
that policy $\pi$ induces.

For IRL we like to recover a weight vector $w$ such that for any
policy $\pi$ we have,
\[
w^\top \mu(\pi^*)\geq w^\top \mu(\pi)
\]
First, we can approximate $\mu(\pi)$ from sample of $m$
trajectories,
\[
\mu(\pi)\approx \hat{\mu}(\pi)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{t=0}^H
\gamma^t \phi(s_t)
\]
Second, observe that if we have $\|\mu(\pi)-\hat{\mu}(\pi)\|_2\leq
\epsilon$ then for any $w$ we have
\[
|w^\top \mu(\pi)-w^\top\hat{\mu}(\pi)|\leq \epsilon \|w\|_2
\]

For the AL we like to find a near optimal policy $\pi'$, but we do
not have access to the rewards. However, if we find a policy $\pi'$
such that $\mu(\pi')\approx\mu(\pi^*)$, then for any weights $w$ the
policy $\pi'$ will give a similar expected return as $\pi^*$.

Consider first the IRL problem. As before, we have a problem that
$w=0$ is a solution. We will overcome this by defining a max margin
linear program.
\begin{align*}
& \max \lambda\\
\forall \pi\;\;\;\;  &  w^\top \mu(\pi^*) \geq w^\top\mu(\pi) +\lambda \\
& \|w\|_2^2 \leq 1
\end{align*}

A clear weakness is that we have an exponential size linear program.
We will overcome this by an {\em incremental constraint generation}
which will solve the AL. We maintain a set of policies $\Pi$, where
initially $\Pi=\emptyset$. Initially we select some $\pi^0$ and let
$\mu^0=\mu(\pi^0)$. At iteration $i$ we solve
\[
\max_w \min_{\pi_j\in \Pi} w^\top (\mu^*-\mu^j)
\]
If the value is at most $\epsilon$ we terminate. Otherwise let $w^i$
be the maximizer. We solve for the optimal policy $\pi^i$ given
weights $w^i$ and add $\pi^i$ to $\Pi$. At termination, we compute a
$\mu=\sum_{i=1}^k a_i\mu^i$ which minimizes $\|\mu^*-\mu\|_2$, where
$a_i\geq 0$ and $\sum_i a_i=1$.

The correctness of the constraint generation follows from the
following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
At termination $\|\mu^*-\mu\|_2\leq \epsilon$
\end{lemma}
We can implement $\mu$ by selecting policy $\pi^i\in\Pi$  with
probability $a_i$ and running it to completion.

The main issue is the rate of convergence. How long will it take to
terminate. The following lemma guarantees the fast convergence.
\begin{lemma}
The number of iterations is bounded by
\[
O(\frac{n}{(1-\gamma)^2\epsilon^2}\log\frac{n}{(1-\gamma)\epsilon})
\]
\end{lemma}
