Up until now, we have discussed \textit{planning} under a known model, such as the MDP. In the remainder of this book, we shall tackle the \textit{learning} setting -- how to make decisions when the model is not known in advance. Before diving in, however, we shall spend some time on defining the various approaches to modeling the learning problem. In the next chapters, we will rigorously cover some of these approaches.
