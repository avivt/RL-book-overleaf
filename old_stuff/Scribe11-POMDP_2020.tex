%%%%%%%%%%%% Subject: template for lecture notes %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Thank you for the hitnadvut to write up notes on today's lecture.
%
% Here is the template file for writing up notes for this course.
% If you scribe on a Tuesday we ask that you please bring your
% notes by the following Tuesday.
%
% To help you with your notes, I can let you copy the notes used in
% giving the lecture. Please ask
% for help in understanding the material or if you have a question
% about how it should be presented.
%
% In order to make the notes more uniform and easier to read, we are providing
% several macros for theorems and such.  (Some examples of their use are
% included below.) Also, we ask that you follow a few stylistic conventions:
%
% Please write your notes as if you were explaining the material to another
% student, rather than as minutes of a meeting. (That is, don't write
% things like ``Today we started discussing...'' or ``next time,
% we will...'' or ``then, someone asked the question...''
% Just explain the material as clearly as you can.
%\
% If you need to refer to an earlier lecture, use the lecture number.
% For example,  ``In Lecture 6 it was shown that...''
% To refer to a later lecture for which you don't know the number,
% just say something like,
% ``This impossibility result will be discussed further in a later
% lecture.'' (At the end of the course, I will go back and fill in the
% appropriate lecture numbers.)
%
% If material from a handout is covered in lecture, then we would like to
% include the text of the handout as a part of the notes to make them more
% self-contained.  To make your job easier, I will mail you the latex
% files for the relevent handouts, and you can merge them in at the
% appropriate places.  Also, you may want to annotate the handout as you
% see fit.  If you happen to take notes on a day that a homework is assigned,
% I will also mail you the exercises, which you can put at the end of your
% notes.
%
% Figures should be done in Latex, if at all possible.  You may have available
% on your system a program called ``texdraw.''  The program lets to draw
% figures with the mouse and then generates a latex file, which you can then
% insert into your text.  If you don't have this program, usually writing the
% latex commands yourself isn't that hard.  For very complicated figures, you
% may wish to leave the appropriate space in the text and draw the figures
% neatly (each on a separate page) in black ink.  For the first draft you
% hand in, you may not want to invest a lot of time drawing the figures very
% neatly, because there's a chance that we will want you to modify
% them.  Save that effort for the draft to be handed out.
%
% Please let me know if you have any questions.
