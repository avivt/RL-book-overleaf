Lecture 5: model based
Add E^3 and maybe reward-free learning

Lecture 6: need to add proofs from [2]
SARSA: complete proof of quality?
First visit empirical model proof.

Lecture 7: extend actor-critic, 
say more on importance sampling.
The empirical MDP estimate for TD, maybe combine with Monte-carlo in Lecture 6?

Learning (chapter) topics:
PAC-MDP
UCRL

Lecture 8:
Add and complete the Linear case (LSTM, and gap w_min w_TD, do convergence?)
Add non-linear on-policy bad example. (The goal is that the table at the end of
the lecture is completely covered)

Lecture 9:
Add policy gradient in the tabular case (?!)

Lecture 10: MAB

Lecture 11: POMDP
Predictive-state-representation
Multiplicity automata?
Sample complexity (key-search exponential in states)

Lecture 12: LQR

Lecture 13:
Apprenterncip learning: add Rob's paper and more
