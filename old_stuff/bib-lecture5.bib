abstract="Efficient exploration is widely recognized as a fundamental challenge inherent in reinforcement learning. Algorithms that explore efficiently converge faster to near-optimal policies. While heuristics techniques are popular in practice, they lack formal guarantees and may not work well in general. This chapter studies algorithms with polynomial sample complexity of exploration, both model-based and model-free ones, in a unified manner. These so-called PAC-MDP algorithms behave near-optimally except in a ``small'' number of steps with high probability. A new learning model known as KWIK is used to unify most existing model-based PAC-MDP algorithms for various subclasses of Markov decision processes.We also compare the sample-complexity framework to alternatives for formalizing exploration efficiency such as regret minimization and Bayes optimal solutions.",
